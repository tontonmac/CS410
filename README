This is your new Play application
=================================

==== Getting started: =====
## Setup your database ##
* install mysql server locally (on osx, I installed mysql 5.6.22 via homebrew)
* create our database user and the database itself:
mysql -uroot
CREATE DATABASE textbook_finder;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON textbook_finder.* To 'textbook'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'shop662_halo';

## Start the play webserver ##
activator run
(or for me on osx: /bin/sh activator run)

## Try it out ##
Access the server with your browser @ http://localhost:9000. Play will automatically connect to the database and apply our schema migrations.

==== Using the importer =====

You can import the departments, courses, classes, etc from the play console.  Note that this is a single threaded import, and currently takes an hour or two to run on my internet connection:

new play.core.StaticApplication(new java.io.File("."))
new util.importer.App("Spring 2015").performImport()

The import can safely be run again at a future date without resulting in all of the data being duplicated.
